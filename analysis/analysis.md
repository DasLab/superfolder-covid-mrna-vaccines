<sup>a</sup>Average unpaired probability over entire coding sequence (Wayment-Steele, 2020b).  
<sup>b</sup>Machine-learning model for predicting degradation more accurately than average unpaired probability (OpenVaccine consortium, 2021, in prep).  
<sup>c</sup>Average unpaired probability of the first 14 nucleotides of the coding sequence (Kozak, 1990; OpenVaccine consortium, 2021, in prep) -- should be *high* to optimize translation.  
<sup>d</sup>Each codon is randomly sampled from the most GC-rich codons for that amino acid (Thess, 2015).  
<sup>e</sup>Zhang, 2020.

The Superfolder construct was optimized by Eterna participants to reduce predicted degradation. It is an adaptation of Superfolder-v1, which had been optimized in RiboTree both to minimize DegScore, maximizing in vitro stability, while keeping the first 14 nucleotides of the coding sequence unpaired.

The Superfolder-B.1.351 construct was developed by enumerating all GC-rich codon substitutions to result in the B.1.351 mutant spike protein, evaluating their DegScore, and selecting the variant with the lowest DegScore.

## Additional mRNA designs

Eterna participants designed S-2P mRNAs with a diversity of structures in OpenVaccine project. 181 constructs were submitted and voted upon by Eterna participants. The top 9 candidates are included in this repository.
